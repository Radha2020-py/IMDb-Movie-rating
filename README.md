This repository includes a few projects I worked on during my PG Diploma in Data Science and my Freelancing work. I've included the Python with detailed comments and pdf files for consolidated presentations wherever applicable. The raw data files for these projects have not been uploaded. However, I may share it exclusively with anyone particularly interested in the details of the Project. I've included a brief description of each project below.

Please Note: If you are a current or future student of the PGDDS program offered by IIIT-Bangalore. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for clarifications. However, I strongly discourage you from integrating sections of the code for your submissions. Every submission is evaluated by a plagiarism checker. A handful of students from my cohort have been penalized for indulging in such activities.
